This is the report of my project where at last I prediction behavioural score probability prediction for defaulting  create a readme.md with good visuals for my github repo

Here's a well-structured README.md file for your GitHub repository. It includes visuals, clear sections, and an engaging format to attract viewers.

Bank Defaulter Risk Prediction Model
Behavioural Score Probability Prediction for Defaulting Customers


An advanced credit risk assessment model to predict customer default probabilities and assign behavioural scores.

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project develops a Bank Defaulter Risk Prediction Model that assigns a Behavioural Score to customers based on their likelihood of default. Using machine learning techniques, particularly LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost, the model predicts default probability and translates it into a Behavioural Score (0-100) to aid financial institutions in risk management.
